# DATA ANALYSIS AGENT
## Overview
This project implements a Python-based Data Analysis Agent that automates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for tabular datasets. At its core, the agent analyzes a given dataset by compressing the dataset schema and storing analysis insights, instead of repeatedly working on raw data or full analysis history.
The agent autonomously:
- Understands the structure of the dataset
- Decides which EDA steps to perform
- Stores insights in memory
- Avoids redundant analysis
The entire system is built using pure Python and lightweight data analysis libraries.
